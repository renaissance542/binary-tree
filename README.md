# binary-tree
Created my own binary tree with associated methods

Live on Replit: xxxxx

Reflection: This project gave me plenty of practice
with recursive methods and binary tree structures.
I was satisfied with my recursive methods, but the other 
methods, such as #delete, felt too long and could  
probably be refactored into something shorter or more 
readable.

Because the focus of this lesson was on data structures,
I disabled Rubocop's ClassLength metric and didn't think
about how to break up this code into an additional module
or class.  That is a lingering question that might get
addressed in a future lesson.
